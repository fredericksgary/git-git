* status
  Want to be able to type `git-git status` and find out what's going
  on.  It should give an idea of what would happen if I did either of
  the other two commands.

  Outputs:

  - Local repos not checked into the metadata
  - Repos in the metadata not present in local
  - Differences in...branch HEADs?

* SHA tracking
  If we commit the HEAD sha of each branch, then we'll be able to tell
  locally if we're at least as up-to-date as the metadata.
